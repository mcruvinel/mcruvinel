## About Me

Quiet mind, sharp code.  
I'm a backend engineer with a taste for infrastructure, clean interfaces, and systems that don’t break under pressure.

At **[LuizaLabs](https://luizalabs.com)**, I build internal tools and APIs that serve real teams at scale.  
I prefer the terminal over the mouse, plain text over noise, and clarity over cleverness.

- Focused on simplicity, performance, and observability  
- Experienced with cloud-native development (S3 APIs, Swift, Kong)  
- Strong on testing, CI/CD, and debugging production systems  
- Passionate about writing documentation that actually helps  
- Toolmaker mindset

## Outside the Terminal

Mountain biker — endurance, interval training & brutal climbs  
Gym rat — strength work to fuel the trail  
Gamer — strategy, sandbox, and retro FPS  
A minimalist with an explorer’s spirit
