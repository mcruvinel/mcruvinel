## 🪪 About Me

Quiet mind, sharp code.  
I'm a backend engineer with a taste for infrastructure, clean interfaces, and systems that don’t break under pressure.

At **[LuizaLabs](https://luizalabs.com)**, I build internal tools and APIs that serve real teams at scale.  
I prefer the terminal over the mouse, plain text over noise, and clarity over cleverness.

- 🧠 Focused on simplicity, performance, and observability  
- ☁️ Experienced with cloud-native development (S3 APIs, Swift, Kong)  
- 🧪 Strong on testing, CI/CD, and debugging production systems  
- ✍️ Passionate about writing documentation that actually helps  
- 🛠️ Toolmaker mindset
